It's probably going to be mostly visited by people that are somehow related to coding and technology, so set your expectations accordingly (i.e. high).</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">Every few weeks there will be a new theme for you to create something: A story, drawings, graffiti, sculpture, original music, live show, some clever xss attack, a git hook - you name it.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">This time (which is also the first time) the subject is "<code class=bg-gold>NULL</code>", and submission is due 15 December, 2018, so we could publish it at the beginning of 2019.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">But before you read the rest, or close the tab, or jump to see the guidelines for submission, answer yourself this: do you feel some excitement about seeing this, but in about a few seconds it's going to die out? Too much work; too much family; you haven't done it for years; you have never done it; etc.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">Maybe you are right and you don't have time for this, or it won't do you any good. I can't set your priorities. But maybe, (maybe!) it's exactly what you need and want right now. I think it's what I want. In fact I'll share a bit why. It's going to be my own personal story (the only story I know how to tell really), but maybe you'll find yourself there. If you do, please send me something you have done.<br>I don't know what sending your work will do to you, but it's surely going to do <em>something</em>.</p><h2 class="f4 f1-ns fw6 mb2">Why</h2><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">While I did finish my B.A. in Fashion Design, and participated in a couple of design competitions, I somehow ended up being a developer. "Ended up" as in I've always been a geek, and it was one of my best decisions.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">I wouldn't want to say I have completely buried my creativity, but I've definitely reduced it to a minimum. I have been writing along the years a few stories for my company that were really just differently approached marketing material. I was always proud of those stories, but got somewhat discouraged they didn't get more exposure. Took me many years to realize that getting clients is one thing (which I still need and want), but getting my work out there is another (which I also still need and want).<br>I'm also clear that if I people don't keep practicing that part of the brain, just like not training out, it slowly washes away. I don't want it to wash away.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">Luckily, the internet just made this self revelation easier to fulfill.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">The name "// This is temporary" is from every piece of code I have ever stared at, that has this comment above it. Never in my life have I've seen such resilient pieces of code, that stayed for so many years. We'll see how this whole thing works out.</p><h2 class="f4 f1-ns fw6 mb2">Submission Guidelines</h2><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">1) Send your work in whatever format you would like: Email, twitter, calling my mobile and streaming your audio recording directly to my ear, etc. Snail mail could also be fun - wouldn't it be awesome to imagine your work floating somewhere in the world, to the hands of a stranger, that will later publish your work? I know I'd be excited about this!<br><br>The contact details are:<br><br>Name: Amitai Burstein<br>Email: amitai@gizra.com<br>Twitter: <a href=https://twitter.com/amitaibu target=_blank>@amitaibu</a><br>Mobile: +972-54-4444-986<br>Address:<address>9 Achad Ha'Am st., Urban Place co-working space<br>Attn. Gizra<br>6525101 Tel-Aviv<br>Israel</address><br></p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">2) Write some instructions on how you want it to be presented. Your real or pseudo name, copyrights, description, links, reviews you've already got, and whatever else you have on your mind. Also, since this is <a href=https://github.com/this-is-temporary/this-is-temporary.art target=_blank>public</a> site built with Jekyll, maybe you can go ahead and create a pull request.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">3) I don't plan to add comments to the site. I was thinking that maybe comments and work reviews can also be sent either by mail or snail mail, to me or directly to you. Creating the slowest commenting system on the internet is a goal on its own.</p><h2 class="f4 f1-ns fw6 mb2">Code of Conduct</h2><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">Honestly, I'm always somewhat twisting my nose at sites with codes of conduct. On the other hand, I'm a white dude, so I guess I'm on the privileged side of things - being so many years in the tech industry taught me that much. So let's start with the "Don't be a jerk," and I'd love to get a PR to add something sensible if you have something in mind.</p><h2 class="f4 f1-ns fw6 mb2">Future</h2><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">We'll figure out as we move. I don't want to to overthink it now - it should be a fun thing, and not about practicing technocracy.</p><p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">Btw, did you notice how I've wrote "We'll", thus trying to make you part of this? Because it's like any other open source project you might be involved with, only different - one with probably way too much emphasis on snail mail. Contributions, as-always, are most welcome.</p></div></div></main><footer></footer><script src=http://localhost:3000/assets/javascript/script.js></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-6558346-17"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
