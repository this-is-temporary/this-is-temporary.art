          This site is a place to encourage you to use your creativity and enjoy
          that of others. It's probably going to be mostly visited by people that
          are somehow related to coding and technology, so set your expectations
          accordingly (i.e. high).
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          Every few weeks there will be a new theme for you to create something:
          A story, drawings, graffiti, sculpture, original music, live show, some
          clever xss attack, a git hook - you name it.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          This time (which is also the first time) the subject is "<code class="bg-gold">NULL</code>",
          and submission is due 15 December, 2018, so we could publish it at the
          beginning of 2019.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          But before you read the rest, or close the tab, or jump to see the guidelines
          for submission, answer yourself this: do you feel some excitement about seeing
          this, but in about a few seconds it's going to die out? Too much work;
          too much family; you haven't done it for years; you have never done it;
          etc.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          Maybe you are right and you don't have time for this, or it won't do
          you any good. I can't set your priorities. But maybe, (maybe!) it's
          exactly what you need and want right now. I think it's what I want.
          In fact I'll share a bit why. It's going to be my own personal story
          (the only story I know how to tell really), but maybe you'll find
          yourself there. If you do, please send me something you have done.
          <br>
          I don't know what sending your work will do to you, but it's surely going to do <em>something</em>.
        </p>

          Why
        </h2>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          While I did finish my B.A. in Fashion Design, and participated in a
          couple of design competitions, I somehow ended up being a developer.
          "Ended up" as in I've always been a geek, and it was one of my best
          decisions.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          I wouldn't want to say I have completely buried my creativity, but I've
          definitely reduced it to a minimum. I have been writing along the years
          a few stories for my company that were really just differently approached
          marketing material. I was always proud of those stories, but got somewhat
          discouraged they didn't get more exposure. Took me many years to realize
          that getting clients is one thing (which I still need and want), but
          getting my work out there is another (which I also still need and want).
          <br>
          I'm also clear that if people don't keep practicing that part of the
          brain, just like not training out, it slowly washes away. I don't want
          it to wash away.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          Luckily, the internet just made this self revelation easier to fulfill.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          The name "// This is temporary" is from every piece of code I have ever
          stared at, that has this comment above it. Never in my life have I've
          seen such resilient pieces of code, that stayed for so many years.
          We'll see how this whole thing works out.

          Submission Guidelines
        </h2>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          1) Send your work in whatever format you would like: Email, twitter,
          calling my mobile and streaming your audio recording directly to my
          ear, etc. Snail mail could also be fun - wouldn't it be awesome to
          imagine your work floating somewhere in the world, to the hands of a
          stranger, that will later publish your work? I know I'd be excited
          about this!

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          2) Write some instructions on how you want it to be presented. Your
          real or pseudo name, copyrights, description, links, reviews you've
          already got, and whatever else you have on your mind. Also, since this
          is <a href="https://github.com/this-is-temporary/this-is-temporary.art" target="_blank">public</a> site built with Jekyll, maybe you can go ahead and create a pull
          request.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          3) I don't plan to add comments to the site. I was thinking that maybe
          comments and work reviews can also be sent either by mail or snail
          mail, to me or directly to you. Creating the slowest commenting system
          on the internet is a goal on its own.

          Code of Conduct
        </h2>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          Honestly, I'm always somewhat twisting my nose at sites with codes of
          conduct. On the other hand, I'm a white dude, so I guess I'm on the
          privileged side of things - being so many years in the tech industry
          taught me that much. So let's start with the "Don't be a jerk," and
          I'd love to get a PR to add something sensible if you have something
          in mind.
        </p>

        <h2 class="f4 f1-ns fw6 mb2">
          Future
        </h2>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          We'll  figure out as we move. I don't want to to overthink it now - it
          should be a fun thing, and not about practicing technocracy.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">
          Btw, did you notice how I've wrote "We'll", thus trying to make you
          part of this? Because it's like any other open source project you
          might be involved with, only different - one with probably way too
          much emphasis on snail mail. Contributions, as-always, are most welcome.
