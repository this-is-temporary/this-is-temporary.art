          This site is a place to encourage you to use your creativity
          and enjoy those of others. It's probably going to be mostly visited by people
          that are somehow related to coding and technology, so get your expectations
          accordingly (i.e. high).
        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          Every few weeks there will be a new theme for you to create something:
          A story, drawings, graffiti, sculpture, original music, live show, some
          clever xss attack, a git hook - you name it.
        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          This time (which is also the first time) the subject is "<code>NULL</code>",
          and submission is until 15 December, 2018, so we could publish it on the beginning of 2019.
        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          But before you read the rest, or close the tab, or jump to see the guidelines
          for submission, answer yourself this: Do you feel some excitement about
          seeing this, but in about a few seconds it's going to die out?
          Too much work; too much family; you haven't done it for years;
          you have never done it; etc.

          Maybe you are right and you don't have time for this, or it won't do you any good.
          I can't set your priorities. But maybe, (maybe!) it's exactly what you
          need and want right now. I think it's what I want. In fact I'll share
          a bit why. It's going to be my own personal story (the only story I
          know how to tell really), but maybe you'll find yourself there. If you do,
          please send me something you have done.
          <br>
          I don't know what sending your work will do to you, but it's surely going to do <em>something</em>.
